            <p>My favorite memory when I was studying in that shcool is that
                they teached me how to code which is obviously not that interesting since I learned how to ride a dragon
                before. </p>
            <aside>My favorite place to hang out when I was free is the Hoboken terminal
                which is always crowded and not that much of fun. </aside>
